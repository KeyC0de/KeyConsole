<hr>


Provision Windows C++ GUI applications with a console for logging or whatever other purpose you choose.

I made this into a separate project because I intend to use it multiple times and others might get some value out of it as well.

I used Windows 8.1 x86_64, Visual Studio 2017, C++17 to build the project.
